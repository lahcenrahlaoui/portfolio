            <div>About Me </div>
            Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I'm a passionate React
            developer building dynamic, responsive online applications .
            <br />
            My passion for web development started out as a simple curiosity in
            HTML and CSS, but it quickly developed into a full-fledged job when
            <br />
            I learned about the React library's strength and adaptability. I'm
            proficient in React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Redux, Node.js,
            and Git techniques, among other technologies.
            <br />
            I have knowledge of software design patterns and best practices in
            addition to having experience in front-end  programming.
            <br />
            As a developer, I am always learning and developing.
